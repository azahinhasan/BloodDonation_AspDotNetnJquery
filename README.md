# BloodDonation_AspDotNetnJquery

## Description  
In backend we used Code Fast method (with auto migration). In frontend we are accessing data by API HTTP request and used jQuery. There are three users Admin, Donor, and User (who are seeking for donor). I did the Admin and Moderator part.  
In this part admin can add a new employee and print the receipt, edit salary info, Promotion/Demotion Employee, disable the account, check all Reports that are made by Users and reviews them if use got too many reports, then Admin/Moderator can Ban/Unban that user, reviews the message of all user which are done from Contact us page and more. 
User (donor seeker) and Donor can do some more things. Users can search for donner and request them for detention. The notification will go to Donner if he accepts it User will get it to know from Notification. Both can edit their profile info. Anyone can make some donations for our site and more.
